Telegram Chat Bot

This Python project implements a simple chat bot using the Telegram Bot API. The bot is capable of responding to user messages with predefined responses and commands. It serves as a basic template for creating custom Telegram bots with minimal setup.

    Message Handling: Processes incoming messages and generates appropriate responses based on predefined rules.
    Error Handling: Logs and handles errors gracefully to ensure uninterrupted bot operation.
    Easy Configuration: Utilizes a Constants module for storing API keys and other configuration constants.
    Modular Responses: Responses are generated using a separate module (Responses) for easy customization and maintenance.

Usage:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Replace the Constants.py file with your Telegram API key.
    Customize the Responses.py module to define your bot's responses.
    Run the main.py script to start the bot.
